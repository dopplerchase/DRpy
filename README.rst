Introduction
++++++++++++

``DRpy`` (pronounced: dur-pee) is a Python package which aims to help users download, process and plot GPM-DPR data.
This package is made and maintained by me, Randy Chase, so if you have any questions feel free to reach out on twitter (`@dopplerchase <https://twitter.com/DopplerChase>`_). 
Alternatively, if you notice broken parts of the code, go ahead and open an issue on the `github repo <https://github.com/dopplerchase/DRpy>`_.

Please go see our ReadTheDocs documentation of how to use this repository. `https://drpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html <https://drpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_

Motivation
**********

GPM-DPR has collected a treasure trove of atmospheric precipitation measurements that can be cumbersome to deal with. As a means to 
accelerate the use of GPM-DPR data in the community and to give me practice with creating high-quality open-source code, 
I have created ``DRpy``.
